# Mulled Wine Tart - v0.2

Makes 2 pies

## Ingredients

- 3 whole star anise
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 6 green cardamom pods
- 3 cloves
- 1 large orange
- White sugar, to taste(See notes)
- 1 bottle of dark, dry red wine
  - I've been going with Dancing Bull Zinfandel
- 2 cans of cherry pie filling
- ~28 grams (2 tbsp) Corn starch
- 2 pie crusts
  - I'm lazy and went with a store bought two-pack of pie crusts

## Prep
- Cut that orange into slices. We're going to lay it in the mulling wine
- Open the cans of cherry pie filling. Set one aside. With the other, empty it into a colander or strainer and rinse off the pie filling jelly - we just want the cherries from this can. Put them back in the can you got them from 
- For later, make a slurry of a 1/4 cup of cold water and the corn starch. Whisk - with a fork or metal whisk - the cornstarch until it looks like a milk based cocktail. We'll use this to thicken the pie.
- Prep your pie crusts ahead of time!
- Divide the rinsed cherries into the bottom of the prepared pie crusts


## Cooking and assembly

1. In a medium to large saucepan add all of the spices 

2. Set on stovetop and medium low heat. We want to VERY 
lightly toast the spices so we can extract just a little more nice flavour out of them. Keep them moving in the pan until they're nice and hot. Don't even let them turn brown! 

3. Lay orange slices onto the hor spices

4. Pour entire bottle of wine over the spice-orange bed

5. Bring to a simmer

6. Turn to low, keep it simmering. Cover.

7. Simmer until it tastes how you want it to! I went for about two to three hours to get the desired spicey-ness, but you can always go longer (or shorter) if you want something different.

8. Once you've reached desired flavour, pour the mixture through a strainer into a large bowl. We want to get out the spices and oranges and keep that mulled wine

9. Empty the can of cherry pie filling that we did not rinse into newly emptied pot

10. Pour the mulled wine from the large bowl over the cherries, and return to a simmer

11. Simmer for an additional 10 minutes so that the cherries are heated and take on some of the flavour

12. Whisk cornstarch slurry (from the prep phase) into the simmering mixture

13. Continue to whisk and simmer for about 5 more minutes. The cherry pie filling will already have made it thick, but we need it just a LITTLE thicker.

14. Remove from heat, let cool for about 10 minutes, just so it's not scorching hot

15. Pour slightly cooled mixture over the cherry added pie crusts, dividing equally. 

16. Let pies cool until room temperature, then place them in the fridge. If you're going to cover them, use some tooth picks and cling film or an inverted plate

17. Chill overnight and until set

18. Cut, serve, enjoy!

## Notes

### White sugar
- v0.1 used about 1/4 a cup of sugar to help sweeten the deal. When using cherry pie filling, sugar was redundant. Taste it while you mull!

### Pears
- For v0.1 I used four pears, peeled and poached in the mulled wine. I couldn't find pears for the next time I made it and switched to canned cherry pie filling and, whoa, world of difference

- If you go for pears instead of cherries, letting the pie "cure" in the fridge for a few of days helps to develop the flavours so much more! When we tried it on the first day it was nothing special. On day four we decided to eat the remainder as not to waste it and were BLOWN away with how amazing the flavour had become
